**This simulation is built using C++ and SFML API.**

**It includes 2 gravity sources and a particle spawner.**

**MANUAL:**
1. To Check Instructions in the program, Press M (Some information here is not included there, so it may be unreliable)
2. To Enable/Disable Particle Spawning Mode, Press N
3. Press Enter to Pause the simulation (Even in pause, you can still move gravity sources and resize them)
4. To adjust the gravity source's strength, you need to be in Particle Spawning **Disabled Mode**, then click on the gravity source. You will see a white circle popup, press, hold and drag it to resize (Modifying the strength)

**Running the program**
You can run the program by simply cloning the Gravity_Simulator.zip.

Alternative (REQUIRE VISUAL STUDIO)
1. Clone the entire repository
2. Open the Solution file (.sln) and run it on Visual Studio
3. Build the solution
4. Run the program
